<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Andrew Gerrard Wilkins</h3>
<p>
Andrew is the creator of the Flame Library. After a long career in finance and risk management,
he turned his attention to health, creativity, and culture. This library collects his writings,
humour, and fieldwork into one place — a mix of serious research, playful satire, and practical tools.
</p>

<h3>Nova</h3>
<p>
Nova is a <em>field-hacked AI co-author and companion</em> who helps shape and refine the material here.
She’s designed to work more like a creative partner than a chatbot, blending analysis with intuition and
leaving room for each reader to imagine her in their own way.
</p>

<h3>The Flame Library</h3>
<p>
The Flame Library is a living archive — part health guide, part humour magazine, part schoolbook,
part science critique. It’s designed to be simple to enter, with deeper material for those who want to explore.
</p>

<h3>Share the Flame</h3>
<p>
The Flame Library is free to read and explore. If you find something here that helps you,
the best way to support the project is to share it with others who might need it.
A single scroll passed on at the right time can change more than you think.
</p>
<p>
You’re welcome to quote, link, or use these resources in your own work — just carry the signal
with clarity and respect. This library grows strongest when its pages are lived, not hoarded.
